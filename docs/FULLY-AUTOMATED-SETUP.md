# 🤖 Fully Automated OrbX Deployment

**ZERO manual secrets needed!** Everything is auto-generated via OrbNet API.

---

## 🎯 What's Different Now?

### ❌ **OLD WAY (What You Didn't Want):**

```
1. Login to OrbNet web interface
2. Manually create server
3. Copy JWT_SECRET
4. Copy ORBNET_API_KEY
5. Paste into deployment config
6. Repeat for each region
```

**Problems:** Too much manual work, error-prone, time-consuming

---

### ✅ **NEW WAY (Fully Automated):**

```
1. Provide your OrbNet admin email/password ONCE
2. Run: ./deploy-all-regions.sh
3. Done! ✨
```

**What happens automatically:**

- ✅ Logs into OrbNet API with your credentials
- ✅ Registers each server automatically
- ✅ Gets API key & JWT secret for each server
- ✅ Deploys with auto-generated credentials
- ✅ Updates OrbNet with server FQDNs
- ✅ **You do NOTHING manually!**

---

## 📦 What You Need (Only 2 Things!)

### 1. **Your OrbNet Admin Credentials**

The email/password you use to login to OrbNet:

- Email: `your-email@example.com`
- Password: `your-password`

### 2. **Azure CLI Installed**

```bash
brew install azure-cli
az login
```

**That's it!** No API keys, no JWT secrets, no manual registration!

---

## 🚀 Complete Setup (10 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Create Config File (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Copy template
cp deployments/azure/.env.deployment.template deployments/azure/.env.deployment

# Edit file
nano deployments/azure/.env.deployment
```

**Only fill in 2 lines:**

```bash
ORBNET_ADMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
ORBNET_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Save and close. **That's all you configure!**

---

### **Step 2: Run Automated Setup (3 minutes)**

```bash
cd deployments/azure/scripts

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Run fully automated setup
./setup-azure-automated.sh
```

**What this does automatically:**

- Creates Azure Container Registry
- Creates Azure Key Vault
- Stores your OrbNet credentials securely
- Logs into OrbNet API
- Creates TLS certificates
- Sets up networking

**You do nothing!** ☕

---

### **Step 3: Build Docker Image (3 minutes)**

```bash
./build-and-push.sh
```

Builds and uploads your OrbX server image.

---

### **Step 4: Test One Server (5 minutes)**

```bash
./deploy-single-test.sh
```

**What happens automatically:**

1. Logs into OrbNet API ✅
2. Registers test server ✅
3. Gets API key & JWT secret ✅
4. Deploys container ✅
5. Tests health endpoint ✅
6. Updates OrbNet with server URL ✅

**Output:**

```
✅ Server registered with OrbNet!
   Server ID: 123
   API Key: orbx_abc123...
   JWT Secret: xYz789...

✅ Container deployed
✅ Health check PASSED!

Test Deployment Successful! ✅
FULLY AUTOMATED - No manual secrets!
```

---

### **Step 5: Deploy All 30 Regions (20 minutes)**

If test passed:

```bash
./deploy-all-regions.sh
```

**Type `yes` and watch the magic! ✨**

**What happens for EACH of the 30 regions:**

1. Logs into OrbNet (using stored credentials) ✅
2. Registers server: "OrbX - East US" ✅
3. Auto-generates unique API key ✅
4. Auto-generates unique JWT secret ✅
5. Deploys container with credentials ✅
6. Updates OrbNet with FQDN ✅

**Result:**

- ✅ 30 servers deployed
- ✅ 30 unique API keys generated
- ✅ 30 unique JWT secrets generated
- ✅ All registered in OrbNet
- ✅ All working and tested

**You never saw or touched a single API key or JWT secret!**

---

## 🎉 What You Get

### **In Azure:**

- 30 OrbX servers running globally
- Each with auto-generated credentials
- All configured and ready

### **In OrbNet:**

- 30 registered servers
- Each tracked individually
- Full metrics and monitoring

### **On Your Machine:**

- `deployed-servers.txt` - List of all 30 servers with URLs
- `test-deployment.txt` - Test server info
- **Zero secrets in git!** (All in Azure Key Vault)

## 🔐 Security Benefits

### **Better Than Manual:**

| Manual Approach                      | Automated Approach                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| One shared API key                   | 30 unique API keys                     |
| One shared JWT secret                | 30 unique JWT secrets                  |
| Keys in config files                 | Keys in memory only                    |
| Keys in git (risk!)                  | Keys never touch disk                  |
| If compromised, all servers affected | If compromised, only 1 server affected |

**Each server has its own credentials = Better security!**

## 📊 Workflow Diagram

```
You provide:
└─> OrbNet Email/Password (ONCE)
    │
    ├─> Script logs into OrbNet API
    │   └─> Gets admin token
    │
    ├─> For Each Region (30x):
    │   │
    │   ├─> Call OrbNet: registerOrbXServer()
    │   │   └─> Returns: { apiKey, jwtSecret }
    │   │
    │   ├─> Deploy container with credentials
    │   │
    │   └─> Call OrbNet: updateServer(fqdn)
    │
    └─> Done! ✅

YOU NEVER TOUCH API KEYS OR JWT SECRETS!

## 🔄 CI/CD (Even More Automated!)

### **Setup GitHub Actions (One-Time):**

```bash
# Create Azure service principal
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "github-actions-orbx" \
  --role contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/$(az account show --query id -o tsv) \
  --sdk-auth

# Add output to GitHub Secrets as: AZURE_CREDENTIALS
```

### **Then Just:**

```bash
# Make code changes
git commit -am "Updated protocol"
git push origin production
```

**GitHub Actions automatically:**

1. Logs into Azure ✅
2. Gets OrbNet credentials from Key Vault ✅
3. Logs into OrbNet API ✅
4. Builds Docker image ✅
5. Tests on 1 server (auto-registers) ✅
6. Deploys to all 30 servers (auto-registers) ✅
7. Verifies all deployments ✅

**You literally just push to git!** 🚀

## 💡 How Credentials Flow

### **Setup Phase (Once):**

```
Your OrbNet Password
    ↓
Stored in Azure Key Vault
    ↓
Retrieved by deployment scripts
    ↓
Used to login to OrbNet API
```

### **Deployment Phase (Per Region):**

```
OrbNet Admin Token
    ↓
Call: registerOrbXServer(region_info)
    ↓
OrbNet generates: { apiKey, jwtSecret }
    ↓
Immediately used to deploy container
    ↓
Credentials stored IN MEMORY in container
    ↓
Never written to disk
    ↓
Container destroyed = credentials gone
```

**At no point do you see or handle API keys!**

## 🆚 Comparison

### **Before (What You Complained About):**

```bash
# For EACH of 30 regions:
1. Open OrbNet web UI
2. Click "Add Server"
3. Fill in: Name, Location, Country...
4. Click "Generate Credentials"
5. Copy API Key → Paste in config
6. Copy JWT Secret → Paste in config
7. Save config file
