- [ ] Network connection stable

### Cost Awareness

- [ ] Understand monthly cost: ~$2,620 for 30 regions
- [ ] Budget approved
- [ ] Billing alerts configured

---

## 📝 Deployment Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Initial Azure Setup (One-Time)

```bash
cd deployments/azure/scripts
./setup-azure.sh
```

**This creates:**

- Resource group for shared resources
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Key Vault
- Virtual network
- Stores your secrets securely

**✅ Success criteria:**

- Script completes without errors
- Can see resources in Azure Portal
- Secrets visible in Key Vault

### Step 2: Build & Push Docker Image (One-Time, then after code changes)

```bash
./build-and-push.sh
```

**This does:**

- Builds multi-arch Docker image
- Pushes to Azure Container Registry
- Tags with version and timestamp

**✅ Success criteria:**

- Build completes successfully
- Image visible in Container Registry
- No build errors

### Step 3: Deploy to All 30 Regions

```bash
./deploy-all-regions.sh
```

**This does:**

- Shows confirmation prompt
- Creates resource group per region
- Deploys container per region
- Generates `deployed-servers.txt`

**✅ Success criteria:**

- All 30 deployments succeed
- `deployed-servers.txt` created
- All containers show "Running" state

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

### Step 4: Test All Deployments

```bash
./test-all-regions.sh
```

**This does:**

- Tests `/health` endpoint on all servers
- Reports success/failure count

**✅ Success criteria:**

- All 30 servers respond "healthy"
- No connection timeouts
- Health check time < 3 seconds per server

---

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Check Azure Portal

1. Navigate to Azure Portal
2. Search for resource groups: `orbx-*-rg`
3. Should see 30 resource groups (one per region)
4. Each should contain one Container Instance

### Test Individual Server

```bash
# Pick any server from deployed-servers.txt
curl -k https://orbx-eastus.eastus.azurecontainer.io:8443/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","uptime":"2m35s"}
```

### Test with JWT Token

```bash
# Get JWT from OrbNet API first, then:
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  https://orbx-eastus.eastus.azurecontainer.io:8443/tunnel \
  -d "test data"
```

### Check OrbNet Registration

1. Login to OrbNet admin panel
2. Navigate to OrbX Servers section
3. Should see all 30 servers registered
4. All should show "Online" status

---

## 🛠️ Management Operations

### View Status of All Servers

```bash
./manage-all-regions.sh status

# Should show table with:
# - Region name
# - Status (Running/Stopped)
# - FQDN
# - IP address
```

### Start/Stop/Restart Operations

```bash
# Stop all (saves money when not needed)
./manage-all-regions.sh stop

# Start all
./manage-all-regions.sh start

# Restart all (e.g., after config change)
./manage-all-regions.sh restart
```

### View Logs

```bash
# Recent logs from all regions
./manage-all-regions.sh logs

# Logs from specific region
az container logs \
  --resource-group orbx-eastus-rg \
  --name orbx-eastus \
  --follow
```

### Update Deployment (After Code Changes)

```bash
# 1. Build new image
./build-and-push.sh

# 2. Restart containers (pulls new image)
./manage-all-regions.sh restart

# 3. Verify
./test-all-regions.sh
```

## 📱 Flutter Client Development - Ready?

### Backend APIs Available

**OrbNet GraphQL API** (for client app):

```graphql
# Login
mutation Login($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  login(email: $email, password: $password) {
    accessToken
    refreshToken
    user {
      id
      email
    }
  }
}

# Get available servers
query GetServers {
  orbxServers(enabled: true, online: true) {
    id
    name
    ipAddress
    port
    location
    country
    protocols
    quantumSafe
    currentConnections
    maxConnections
    latencyMs
  }
}

# Get best server
query GetBestServer {
  bestOrbXServer {
    id
    name
    ipAddress
    port
    protocols
  }
}
```

**OrbX Server Endpoints** (for VPN connection):

```
Protocol Selection:
- POST /tunnel              → Generic encrypted tunnel
- POST /teams/messages      → Disguised as Teams
- POST /shaparak/transaction → Disguised as Iranian banking
- GET|POST /dns-query       → Disguised as DNS over HTTPS

Headers Required:
- Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
- Content-Type: application/octet-stream (for tunnel)
```
